# iterator-essence
The essence of the iterator pattern in JavaScript

This is a laboratory for studying functors, applicatives (aka idioms) and monads along the lines exposed in [1] and [2].

Language is JavaScript and coding style is inspired to the macroids presented in [3].

At the present moment:

- functors are pretty much formalized (but functor composition still has to be well understood)

- applicatives are on the way, especially thanks to the clear exposition presented in [4].
